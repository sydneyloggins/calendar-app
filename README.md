# Calendar App

## Description

This project utilizes Moment.js to create a calendar app that saves events to local storage when the page is refreshed. The motivation behind this project is to learn how to implement Moment.js in an application effectively, I built this project to understand how to tie together HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with server-side APIs to create an application. The project allows users to input an event during the work day hour and save the event to local storage where the event will stay until the user deletes it. 

## Installation

Follow this link to access the application: 

## Usage

When the application loads, the current time and date is displayed at the top of the page: ![Screenshot 2023-04-19 at 11 32 06 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125998308/233141141-67c0c9e5-f8a9-4de7-b26d-39e4d7fff0da.png)


The current time block will be red, future blocks green, and past blocks are grey: ![Screenshot 2023-04-19 at 11 32 20 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125998308/233141294-c84d0778-c01c-4ddb-8225-08ecbdf50759.png)


When a user inputs an event and presses the save button, an alert lets the user know the event is saved to local storage: ![Screenshot 2023-04-19 at 11 32 28 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125998308/233141337-fece7dba-8814-4d43-b442-e0e04e68d6d0.png)


When user refreshes, the events are still in the time blocks.
